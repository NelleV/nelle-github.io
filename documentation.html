Chris Holdgraf</em></p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Institute for Data Science</a> hosts
research, events, and tool development focused on facilitating data-intensive
research. Today, computational research and data analytics relies on complex
ecosystems of open source software (OSS) tools and libraries. Software
documentation is crucial to help researchers discover and use these tools, to
help build a community ecosystem of data science packages, and to define best
practices in the field. However, software documentation in open source is
notoriously considered low-quality. Why is good documentation so difficult to
write in open source software, what can communities do to better support good
documentation in their projects?</p>
<p>We, (BIDS fellows &amp; researchers <a class="reference external" href="http://stuartgeiger.com/">Stuart Geiger</a>,
Nelle Varoquaux, <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/charlotte-cabasse">Charlotte Mazel-Cabasse</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://predictablynoisy.com/">Chris Holdgraf</a>) recently published a study about the types,
roles, and practices of documentation in open source software projects,
focusing on data analytics software libraries like ggplot2, pandas, or
Matplotlib. <a class="reference external" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1">The paper appears in the Journal of Computer-Supported
Cooperative Work, a premier venue for research on the social and technical
dimensions of collaboration</a>.</p>
<p>The study was based on interviews with novice and veteran documentation
contributors to open source data analytics software libraries, additionally
drawing on Stuart and Charlotte's broader ethnographic research into data
science as well as Nelle and Chris's extensive experience participating in
many OSS projects. The study began as part of the Docathon event held at BIDS,
UW's eScience Institute, and virtually around the world, in which contributors
pledged to spend time together writing documentation.</p>
<p>We discuss the many types and formats of documentation, ranging from short
examples to book-like tutorials. Each of the types and formats play different
and complementary part in educating, promoting, and organizing the tools. One
challenge around documentation is that so many types of documentation serve
different purposes for different audiences. The practices of documentation
themselves are multifaceted, and require a broad range of skills, such as
writing, reviewing, maintaining documentation, and coding. Documentation
contributors require a large set of skills beyond that of software
development, and often need to overcome many social and technical barriers to
contribute to a projectâ€™s documentation.</p>
<p>Last but not least, most contributors do not inherently enjoy writing
documentation, compared to writing code. One of our interviewee stated that
<em>&quot;We all hate writing documentation&quot;</em> -- although we did find a small number of
people who enjoy it as much as writing code. Some volunteer as a sense of
responsibility, or because the project they contributed to required to do so.
In addition, many contributors stated that they did not feel like they
received same levels of positive community feedback for documentation work as
they did for adding new features or fixing bugs. We identify issues around
what kinds of work receive recognition and credit in various communities. Even
though writing documentation involves substantial technical expertise, it is
often seen as a trivial &quot;non-technical&quot; chore, which impacts motivation.
Overall, contributors felt they lacked the incentive, motivation and credit
for writing documentation from the broader community.</p>

<p>We also identify substantial &quot;documentation guilt&quot; around not writing or
updating documentation, as documentation is a kind of task that is often left
for later -- if at all. At the 2017 SciPy conference, the results of a survey
around the practices of documentation found that 76.5% of the respondents felt
they should spend more time writing documentation than they do!</p>
<p>This research project has also been a compelling case of ethnographers
collaborating with data scientists to empirically study the people, practices,
and platforms behind the scenes of data science --- what we call &quot;data science
studies.&quot; Our paper was written to speak to both open source software
contributors and social science researchers, as we believe there is much to be
learned in bringing these groups closer together. In combining our various
strengths and expertises, we are able to turn the research lens on data
science itself. With such research, we better understand what is needed to
support and sustain the critical infrastructure we rely on for doing data- and
computationally-intensive research in open and reproducible ways.</p>
<p>The paper has already received substantial attention both from the open source
software community and the CSCW research community: the paper won an honorable
mention for the annual David B. Martin best paper award, the presentation of
the paper won best presentation at the ECSCW 2018 conference, and it is the
most shared paper on social media published in the last five years in the
Journal of CSCW according to <a class="reference external" href="https://springeropen.altmetric.com/details/42926574">altmetric.com</a>. We are thrilled by
this response, and stay tuned for more collaborative research in this area!</p>
